# Setting Up Your Classmoji Account

Getting started with Classmoji takes just a few steps—and you only need to do it once.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Log in with GitHub

- Go to [Classmoji](https://classmoji.io/) and click “Sign In”.
- Log in using your GitHub account.
- If you don’t have a GitHub account, [create one here](https://github.com/join) before logging in.

Classmoji uses your GitHub account to:
- Match you to your classroom
- Create your assignment repositories
- Track submissions and grading

---

## 🪪 Step 2: Confirm Your Identity (First-Time Only)

The first time you log in, you’ll be asked to confirm:
- Your school email
- Your student ID

This helps your instructor make sure the right work is associated with the right student.

You won’t need to do this again after the first time.

---

## 🏫 Step 3: Join Your Class

- After logging in, you’ll see cards for each class you’ve been invited to.
- Click on your class card to trigger a GitHub invite to the course’s organization.
- Check your email for the invite and accept it to gain access to your private module repositories.

From there, you're ready to start submitting work and getting feedback!
